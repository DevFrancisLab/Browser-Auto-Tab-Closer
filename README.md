# Tab Auto-Manager Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension automatically closes inactive tabs after a specified period of time. It helps users manage browser tabs and keep their workspace uncluttered. Tabs that are playing audio, active, or belong to a pre-configured list of streaming sites (like YouTube, Netflix, etc.) are excluded from auto-closing. Users can also whitelist specific tabs from closure via a prompt.

## Features
- Automatically closes inactive tabs after a specified amount of time.
- Excludes active tabs, tabs playing audio, and tabs from a list of streaming sites.
- Allows users to whitelist specific tabs from auto-closure via a prompt.
- Customizable time limit for tab closure.
- Streaming sites loaded from an external JSON file.

## How It Works
1. The extension tracks the last time a tab was accessed or updated.
2. If a tab has been inactive for longer than the specified time limit (default is 8 hours), it will be automatically closed, unless it meets exclusion criteria.
3. Tabs playing audio or from an excluded domain (such as YouTube, Netflix, etc.) are ignored and won't be closed.
4. Users can also be prompted to whitelist specific tabs before automatic closure.

## Excluded Streaming Sites
Tabs from the following streaming sites are excluded from auto-closing by default:
- youtube.com
- netflix.com
- hulu.com
- twitch.tv
- vimeo.com
- disneyplus.com
- primevideo.com
- zoom.us
- teams.microsoft.com
- meet.google.com
- dailymotion.com
- spotify.com
- apple.com
- facebook.com
- screenrecorder.com

These domains are loaded from the `streaming_sites.json` file.
